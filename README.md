Effect Pedal - Manuel Krahe Fernandez / 6061451

i. This project will be based around the theme of system and signals. I will make one (or several) effect pedals with interactive features. This pedal will convert sound signals and modify them in a way which changes the sound (produce distortion for example). Ideally this project works so that the user can upload a music file, and would be able to put some effects on it.

ii. For this project I found several libraries which  believe will come in handy: NumPy, SciPy, PyAudio, librosa, Matplotlib and Tkinter. As for methods to manipulate the input and get the desired output signal, I will be using several things Paco tought us in the system and signals lectures (using convulotion for example). 

iii. Potential data I might need for this project are impulse response files that can be found for free on the internet, and test audio clips from several instruments to test the program.

iv. The expected outcome of this project is that the user can input music and can put effects on it in real time without troubles.
